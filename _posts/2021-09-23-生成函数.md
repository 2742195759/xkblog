### Abstract

This artical mainly introducts the original of generating function, the main theorem of generating function and the usage of generating function. 



##### Origin of Generating Function

Generating function is a useful tool in Combinatorial Mathematic. Some complex combination problem can be solved easily by generating function.  Let's start with a combination problem :

>  **Problem** : There are 1 gram, 2 gram, 3 gram and 4 gram weights for each one, What kinds of weights can be weight ? How many possible solutions are there for each weight ? Different sequences are regarded as different schemes.

>  **Solve：**
>
> $\square$​



##### Relation between Generating Function and Taylor series expansion

> **Lemma : ** $\lim_{x\rightarrow0} \frac{\delta^n \Omicron (x^n)}{\delta x^n} = 0$  where $\Omicron(x^n)$ means higher order infinitesimal of $x^n$​ . 
>
> **Prove : ** we can use Law of Robida to get this. 

 

> **Definition : **  If $F(x)$​​​​​​ have the taylor series expansion $\sum_i a_i x^i$​​​​​​, we write $F(x) \sim \{a_n\}$​​​​​ . 



> **Theorem[Taylor Series] : **  If $F(x) \sim \{a_n\}$ , then $\frac{\delta^n F(x)}{\delta x^n}|_{x\rightarrow0} = a_n * n!$

> **Prove : **
>
> $F(x) \sim \{a_n\}$​​​, we can have $F(x) = \sum_i^n a_i x^i + \Omicron(x^n)$​​​  where $\Omicron(x^n)$​​​ means higher order infinitesimal of $x^n$​​​ . The n-th derivative of $F(x)$​​​ is  $\frac{\delta^n F(x)}{\delta x^n}|_{x\rightarrow0} = a_n * n! $​​​ 
>
> $\square$​



> **Theorem : **  If $F(x) \sim \{a_n\}$​​​​ and $G(x) \sim \{b_n\}$​​​​,  then $F(x)G(x) \sim \{a_n \bigotimes b_n \}$​​​​​​​ .

> **Prove : ** 



##### Example and Usage

There is a nice example, which is to solve Catalan Number by using generating function : 

> **Definition : ** If $C_{n+1} = \sum_{i=0}^{n} C_n C_{n-i}$​​​ and $C_0 = 1; C_1 = 1$​, then C is called Catelan Number . 

The definition of Catalan numbers originate from combination problem : many problems can derive catalan numbers. It is hard to derive the general term formula by induction, however, with the help of generating function, we can find the general term formula of catalan number. 

> **Theorem : **   The general term formula of catalan number is $C_n = \frac{1}{n+1}\mathbf{C}_{2n}^{n}$​
>
> **Prove : ** 
>
> let $F(x) \sim C_n$​​​ , we can find that
